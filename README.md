# PDScheduling - a library to create schedules in PagerDuty

Just generate an array with a user for every hour for the next week - and the library will push it to PagerDuty. 

## Example:

```python
import random
from pdscheduling import PagerDuty

pd = PagerDuty("token")
users = pd.get_users()
schedule = []
for day in range(7):
    user = random.choice(users) # your fancy algorithm to select a user for the day
    for hour in range(24): # btw, the week starts in UTC timezone
        schedule += [user["id"]]
pd.create_or_update_schedule(name="Automatic Schedule", hours=schedule)
```

## Why library? Can I just use PagerDuty API?

You can, but it will be harder. PagerDuty don't give straightforward API for this, instead you need to create schedule
with a layer for every developer with proper restriction.

## Limitation

Library can fetch only first 100 users and schedules. It's possible to fix, I just did not prioritize this feature.
